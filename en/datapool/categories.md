# General

Internal categories in the datapool are used to assign product data to (internal) categories and item characteristics on marketplaces such as eBay and Amazon. They can be edited, imported and exported. All item features should always be assigned here first.

> Assigning products to internal categories is an important prerequisite for exporting your data incl. shop categories in the Export section.

***
# Assignments

Assignments of products to internal categories can be made as follows:
- during the import of product data

- under Datapool ->Products via the category selection, or

- directly via the button `Synchronize product category`

> We recommend that you generally assign all products to internal categories. Ideally, this works together with the import of product data.

If an import file does not contain any categories, our system assigns its own category IDs. Via the internal categories, the assignment to the categories of your CSV or XML interface (to the categories of your shop) takes place later in the Export area.

# Overview categories

After setting up internal categories, the number of products stored per category is displayed here. You can also see whether you have already made assignments to marketplace categories. By clicking on the corresponding country abbreviation, you can set up new allocations and article characteristics or edit existing allocations.

To edit an internal category, click on the category name. A new page opens on which you can edit the category's properties and allocations, e.g. to Amazon and eBay.
